<!--HTML in partial files still can be altered by the CSS file in the public static folder!-->
<!--1. The request comes in and we compile the handlerbars template to HTML and send that to the client.
    2. The browser sees the link tag and then sends another request to our server.
    3. Our express.static() middleware serves the CSS file for that request.-->
